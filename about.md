First organized in 2004 by Rachel Altman and Jason Loeppky, the Vancouver Joint Statistics Seminar provides a valuable opportunity for statistics and actuarial science students at SFU and UBC to attend a seminar with accessible talks, network with peers, and hear from leading faculty and industry researchers about a variety of topics. It is held twice a year, with the Fall seminar organized by the students at SFU and the Spring seminar organized by the students at UBC.
